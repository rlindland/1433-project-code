# 14.33 Project Code

To reproduce the regressions in the paper, simply run the stata file regressions.do. The import statements will need to be modified to point to the data stored locally. All data is provided. Descriptions of each file is given below:
- data_code.ipynb : A python notebook used to produce all the data necessary for the regressions. Running this code isn't necessary since all data sets are in the repository.
- regressions.do : A stata file that produces all tables and figures shown in the paper.
- formatted_data.csv : The primary data set used for every regression except the placebo tests.
- placebo_data.csv : The placebo data used in the placebo tests.
- real_data.csv : The real data used in the placebo tests.
